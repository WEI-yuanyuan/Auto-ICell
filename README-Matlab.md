## Usage

1. Place `.tif` images into the corresponding `Sample*` folder.
2. Run one of the main scripts based on your task:

% RGB-based analysis
plot_distribution

% HSV-based segmentation
test2

% HSV + registration
test2_vBB

## Outputs
ROI-enhanced images and masks
Area statistics and intensity distribution plots
Registered image sequences

## Requirements
MATLAB R2018a or later
Image Processing Toolbox
Optional: mtimesx for fast matrix operations
